# Threatened-Species-Power-BI-Dashboard

Overview
The Threatened Species Dashboard provides an interactive and data-driven exploration of global biodiversity loss. It visualizes the number and categories of endangered, critically endangered, and extinct animal species across different countries, helping users understand both the scale and distribution of ecological threats.

This project highlights regions with high concentrations of at-risk species, as well as areas showing lower levels of impactâ€”offering valuable insights for conservation strategies, research, and public awareness.

Key Features
This Power BI dashboard incorporates a range of visualizations and interactive elements for intuitive and impactful analysis:

Multi-line charts to display species trends over time

Treemaps for a country-wise breakdown of species types

Stacked bar charts to show the distribution across species categories (e.g., mammals, birds, reptiles)

Card visuals summarizing key metrics such as total affected species and regional highlights

Smart Narratives to auto-generate dynamic insights based on user selections

Slicers to filter data by country, species type, and threat factors for customized views

Dataset Summary
This dashboard is powered by two datasets:

Threatened Species Dataset
Includes country-level data on animal species categorized as endangered, critically endangered, and extinct. It provides a global snapshot of biodiversity at risk.

Threats to Wildlife Dataset
Details the major contributing factors to species decline, such as habitat destruction, climate change, pollution, and poaching. This helps contextualize where and why species are being affected.

Purpose
The project is intended to support environmental researchers, policymakers, and conservationists by transforming raw data into meaningful visual stories. It serves as a tool for education, advocacy, and strategic decision-making in global biodiversity preservation efforts.
